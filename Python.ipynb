    "### Core Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static Typing**: Types are checked at compile time, before the program runs. Variables must be declared with specific types, and type errors are caught early.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Typing**: Types are checked at runtime, during program execution. Variables can hold values of any type, and type errors only surface when the problematic code actually executes.\n",

    "Variable Declaration\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python - No type declaration needed\n",
    "x = 42        # x is an integer\n",

    "## 2: Core Language Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types & Structures\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Built-in types\n",
    "int, float, complex, bool\n",
    "str, bytes, bytearray\n",
    "list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advanced collections\n",
    "from collections import namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter, deque, ChainMap\n",
    "from collections.abc import Sequence, Mapping, MutableMapping\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Namedtuples** in Python are a subclass of the built-in tuple data type. They provide a way to create tuple-like objects with named fields, making the code more readable and self-documenting. \n",
    "Here are some key aspects of named tuples: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Immutability: Like regular tuples, named tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be modified after creation. \n",
    "• Named Fields: Each element in a named tuple can be accessed by its name, using dot notation (e.g., my_tuple.field_name). \n",
    "• Creation: Named tuples are created using the namedtuple() function from the collections module. This function takes the name of the tuple type and a list of field names as arguments. \n",
    "• Access: Elements can be accessed by their name or index, just like regular tuples. \n",
    "• Use Cases: Named tuples are useful when you need to represent records or structures with a fixed number of fields, where each field has a specific meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from collections import namedtuple\n",
    "\n",
    "#Define a named tuple type called \"Point\" with fields \"x\" and \"y\"\n",
    "Point = namedtuple(\"Point\", [\"x\", \"y\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "#Create a Point instance\n",
    "p1 = Point(x=10, y=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Access fields by name\n",
    "print(p1.x)  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(p1.y)  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "#Access fields by index\n",
    "print(p1[0])  # Output: 10\n",
    "print(p1[1])  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "Benefits of using named tuples: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Readability: Makes code more readable and understandable by providing meaningful names for tuple elements. \n",
    "• Self-documenting: The field names act as documentation, clarifying the purpose of each element. \n",
    "• Lightweight: Named tuples are more lightweight than classes for simple data structures. \n",
    "• Immutability: Ensures data integrity by preventing accidental modification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The defaultdict** in Python is a container within the collections module that functions similarly to a standard dictionary (dict) but with a key difference: it automatically assigns a default value to a key if the key is not already present in the dictionary. This eliminates the need for explicit checks or exception handling when accessing or modifying values, preventing KeyError exceptions.\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its key features: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Default Factory: When a defaultdict is created, you specify a \"default factory\" function. This function is called whenever a key is accessed that doesn't exist, and its return value is used as the default value for that key.\n",
    "• Automatic Key Creation: If a key is not found in the dictionary, instead of raising a KeyError, the default_factory is called to create a new key with the default value.\n",
    "• Common Use Cases: \n",
    "\t• Counting Items: Using defaultdict(int) to count occurrences of items. \n",
    "\t• Grouping Items: Using defaultdict(list) to group items based on a key. \n",
    "\t• Handling Missing Data: Providing default values for missing keys in data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = defaultdict(int)\n",
    "my_dict[\"a\"] += 1 # This will initialize \"a\" to 0 and then increment it\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"a\"]) # Output: 1\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"b\"]) # Output: 0, as \"b\" will be initialized to 0\n",
    "my_list_dict = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "my_list_dict[\"x\"].append(1)\n",
    "my_list_dict[\"x\"].append(2)\n",
    "print(my_list_dict[\"x\"]) # Output: [1, 2]\n",
    "print(my_list_dict[\"y\"]) # Output: [], as \"y\" will be initialized to an empty list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Counter** class, found within Python's collections module, is a specialized dictionary subclass designed for counting hashable objects. It stores elements as dictionary keys and their counts as dictionary values. \n",
    "Here are some key features of Counter: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Initialization: Counter objects can be initialized from iterables, mappings, or keyword arguments. \n",
    "• Counting: It efficiently counts the occurrences of items in an iterable. \n",
    "• Dictionary Interface: Counter objects behave like dictionaries, but accessing a missing key returns a zero count instead of raising a KeyError. \n",
    "• Mutable: Counts can be updated, and elements can be added or removed. \n",
    "• Multiset Operations: Counter objects support multiset operations like addition, subtraction, intersection, and union. \n",
    "• Methods: It provides useful methods like elements() (returns an iterator over elements), most_common() (returns the n most common elements), and update() (adds counts from another iterable or mapping). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from collections import Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "#Initialize a counter with a list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n",
    "counter = Counter(my_list)\n",
    "print(counter) # Output: Counter({3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1})\n",
    "\n",
    "#Accessing counts\n",
    "print(counter[2]) # Output: 2\n",
    "print(counter[4]) # Output: 0 (missing key)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Updating counts\n",
    "counter.update([2, 3, 4])\n",
    "print(counter) # Output: Counter({3: 4, 2: 3, 1: 1, 4: 1})\n",
    "\n",
    "#Most common elements\n",
    "print(counter.most_common(2)) # Output: [(3, 4), (2, 3)] i.e. 3 -> 4X and 2 -> 3X\n",
    "```\n",
    "• Counter objects do not maintain the order of elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A deque (double-ended queue)** is a data structure that allows you to add and remove elements from both ends efficiently. It is implemented in Python's collections module.\n",
    "Key Features: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Efficient operations: deque supports O(1) time complexity for appending and popping elements from both ends, making it more efficient than lists for these operations. \n",
    "• Versatile: It can be used to implement both queues (FIFO) and stacks (LIFO). \n",
    "• Thread-safe: deque operations are thread-safe, allowing for concurrent access from different threads. \n",
    "• Memory efficient: It is optimized for memory usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common Use Cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Implementing queues and stacks. \n",
    "• Sliding window algorithms. \n",
    "• Tracking recent history with a limited-size buffer. \n",
    "• Any situation where you need fast access to both ends of a sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Operations: \n",
    "\n",
    "• append(x): Adds an element to the right end. \n",
    "• appendleft(x): Adds an element to the left end. \n",
    "• pop(): Removes and returns an element from the right end. \n",
    "• popleft(): Removes and returns an element from the left end. \n",
    "• len(deque): Returns the number of elements in the deque. \n",
    "• deque[0]: Access the first element. \n",
    "• deque[-1]: Access the last element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: \n",
    "\n",
    "• deque can be implemented using a doubly linked list. \n",
    "• Python's built-in collections.deque is highly optimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "When to use deque over list: \n",
    "\n",
    "• When you need fast appends and pops from both ends. \n",
    "• When you need to implement queues or stacks. \n",
    "• When you need thread-safe operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "When to use list over deque: \n",
    "\n",
    "• When you need random access to elements (indexing). \n",
    "• When you don't need to frequently add or remove elements from both ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ChainMap** is a class in Python's collections module that groups multiple dictionaries (or other mappings) into a single, updateable view. It allows you to treat multiple dictionaries as one, which can be useful for managing configurations, default values, and overrides. \n",
    "Key Features: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Multiple Mappings: ChainMap takes multiple dictionaries as input and stores them internally as a list. \n",
    "• Single View: It provides a single view that allows you to access and modify the dictionaries as if they were one. \n",
    "• Lookup Order: When searching for a key, ChainMap iterates through the underlying mappings in the order they were provided during initialization. The first mapping containing the key will be the one that returns the value. \n",
    "• Updatable: Changes made to the ChainMap are reflected in the first mapping in the list. \n",
    "• No Copying: ChainMap does not create copies of the underlying dictionaries, but it stores references to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to use it: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import ChainMap\n",
    "\n",
    "dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n",
    "dict3 = {'c': 5, 'd': 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a ChainMap\n",
    "combined_map = ChainMap(dict1, dict2, dict3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access elements\n",
    "print(combined_map['a'])  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(combined_map['b'])  # Output: 2 (from dict1, the first occurrence)\n",
    "print(combined_map['c'])  # Output: 4 (from dict2, the first occurrence)\n",
    "print(combined_map['d'])  # Output: 6 (from dict3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify elements\n",
    "combined_map['b'] = 10\n",
    "print(combined_map['b'])   # Output: 10\n",
    "print(dict1['b'])         # Output: 10 (dict1 is updated)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access all keys and values\n",
    "print(combined_map.keys())\n",
    "print(combined_map.values())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access all mappings\n",
    "print(combined_map.maps)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use Cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "• Configuration Management: Useful for managing configurations with different priorities (e.g., command-line arguments, environment variables, default values). \n",
    "• Context Management: Can be used to manage different contexts or scopes in a program. \n",
    "• Simplified Lookups: ChainMap can simplify lookups when dealing with multiple sources of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "When to use it: \n",
    "ChainMap is a good choice when you have multiple dictionaries that you want to treat as a single unit, with a specific lookup order and the ability to update the first dictionary. It is particularly useful when you need to manage configuration or context with different levels of priority. \n",
